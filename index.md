title: "The Humans, Data, and Computers Lab"
---

At the HDC Lab, we study how computer science interacts with human
experiences, at all levels. We specialize in novel algorithms for
interactive visualization and exploratory data analysis. This ranges
from creating
[mathematical foundations for the evaluation of visualization designs](http://algebraicvis.net),
to
[novel data structures and systems for interactive data analysis at scale](http://nanocubes.net),
to
[novel ways to characterize data-driven discrimination](http://fairness.haverford.edu).

When human concerns and our modern technological society overlap, we
strive to advance computer science in order to help people lead better lives.

We are part of the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.arizona.edu) at the
[University of Arizona](http://www.arizona.edu)'s [College of Science](http://cos.arizona.edu/).
