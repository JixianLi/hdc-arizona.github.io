# Software

We keep publicly-available software on our
[GitHub organization](http://github.com/hdc-arizona).

## Languages

You can use whatever programming language you feel most comfortable
with, but the majority of us speak some mix of C++, Javascript, and
Python.

Since we are all going to be writing a lot of software together, it
makes sense to standardize on the style we use. We try to adhere to
Google's style guides whenever possible. This means, mostly that we'll use:

* [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
* [Google's Javascript style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml)
* [Google's Python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)

## Licenses

Unless there's a reason to choose otherwise, pick the
[MIT license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit).  Also note that
all the code you develop as part of your work will have the following
copyright line:

`Copyright 2015- Arizona Board of Regents`

# Communication

We're trying out [Slack](https://hdcarizona.slack.com/) for a
catch-all IRC and IM equivalent. Send email to Carlos if you'd like an
invite.
